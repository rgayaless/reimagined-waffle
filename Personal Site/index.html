    <h1>Randal G Ayales Salgado</h1>
    <p><em>Founder and CTO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/randal-g-a-7516a377/">Securisk Technologies</a></em></p>
    <p>Risk & Loss Prevention analyst with 10+ years of experience who has had the pleasure of working directly in various industries to assist in building multiple loss prevention 
        strategies by conducting deep dives into historical records, analyzing previous risk trends based on fraudulent transactions and creating a story of the market being analyzed 
        to better understand it's risk factors based on constantly changing variables such as card preference, age groups, behavioral analytics and account activity. This with current market loss
        prevention tools available assisted in mitigating and reducing overall fraud and dispute rates within acceptable risk appetites for different merchants.

        Due to this background and finding a gap within a market that just had the next big thing but did not fill all lose ends I decided to embark in this new journey to create a platform to
        assist with all vectors in risk management such as:

        <ol>
            <li>Third Party Risk Management</li>
            <li>KYB & KYC</li>
            <li>Consumer facing Risk Management</li>
            <li>Real-time Online Payment Fraud Screening</li>
            <li>Device Fingerprinting</li>

        </ol>
