    <h1>Randal G Ayales Salgado</h1>
    <p><em>Founder and CTO of Securisk Technologies</em></p>
    <p>I am a Risk & Loss Prevention 10+ years veteran. I have had the pleasure of working directly in various industries to asist in their loss prevention stratagies through 
        deep diving in historical records and providing a story of their ever changing risk landscape so that they undertood what to expect next. I belive that through data you can
        uncover many unforseen hints on how hreat actors are taking advantage of our defects.
